- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think inheritance definitely makes programming easier and more flexible, because I can make lots of different buildings, aka lots of different similar objects.

I should've started the assignment earlier, I am still having trouble figuring out how to print the library collection in a nicer format, but I plan to edit this assignment after I submit this initial draft. I think this assignment definitely went the smoothest out of the other assignments I have previously done in this class. The code alongs really help me because they are examples that I can follow.
