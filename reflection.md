Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

Which methods did you decide to overload, and why?
For the Library class, I decided to overload checkOut and returnBook, because I wanted to give users the option to return and check out multiple books at once.

For the House class, I decided to overload the constructor and moveIn(), because I wanted users to be able to create houses even if booleans such as having a dining room didn't apply or if they only knew whose house it was and not the address or other details. I overlaoded moveIn() so that roommates can move in to their room at the same time.

For the Cafe class, I thought that ounces of coffee could also be a double and not only an integer value, so I overloaded the restock method. I also overloaded the sellCoffee method so that users could buy different quantities of simple coffee orders without sugar and cream. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I thought this assignment went pretty smoothly. I think it would've been helpful to have some sort of code along on the Moodle for overloading examples, but it was definitely manageable even without that additional resource. I had a lot of fun with this assignment. I am also glad it was split into two parts and wasn't all due at once.
